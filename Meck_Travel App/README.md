# Final Project: Travel App
***

## Overview
This project requires the creation of an asynchronous web app that uses at least three Web API's and updates the UI with the results of those calls. 

## Main Idea
The user inputs the city they are visiting and the date they are leaving. On the click the UI is updated and the user receives information for the trip such as: how many days remain until departure, the country the city is in and weather for the departure day. A photo from that city is also included.

## Extras
I chose to incorporate the extra element of having a photo loaded from the country if there are no photos available for the city.
